# project-head-motion-control-wheel-chair-using-gesture-control
The Head Motion Controlled Wheelchair is a smart system for physically challenged people, letting them control movement using head gestures (left, right, forward, backward). Sensors detect gestures, and an Arduino processes them to drive the wheelchair, eliminating the need for hand-based controls.

# 🦾 Head Motion Controlled Wheelchair

### 🚀 Overview
A smart assistive mobility system that allows wheelchair movement using **head gestures** instead of a joystick.  
Designed for **physically challenged users**, this project enables **hands-free control** with the help of sensors and Arduino-based automation.

### ⚙️ Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- MPU6050 Sensor (Accelerometer + Gyroscope)  
- L293D Motor Driver  
- DC Motors  
- 12V Battery  
- Wheelchair Chassis  

### 💡 Working
MPU6050 detects the head's tilt and sends data to Arduino.  
Arduino drives the motors through L293D:  
- Forward tilt → Move forward  
- Backward tilt → Move backward  
- Left tilt → Turn left  
- Right tilt → Turn right  
- Neutral → Stop  

### 🧠 Features
- Hands-free motion  
- Real-time detection  
- Safety stop  
- Low cost and easy assembly
